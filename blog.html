A critic wrote that "Allu Arjun puts in a confident performance as the loveable rogue. It's a role that is right up his alley and he carries it off with a characteristic panache. He lights up the screen with his dancing in particular, pulling off some pretty challenging dance moves."[67] Riya Chakravarty of NDTV, in her review, stated that "Arjun has delivered an outstanding performance."[68] He was nominated for the SIIMA Award for Best Actor – Telugu, for his performance in the film.

His character of a guitarist, who is a street performer in Barcelona, was at its best sketchy, and looks completely different from his previous films. He once again proves that he is a good actor and probably because of the action director's meticulous planning, he makes perfect expressions in all the fight scenes."[70][71] The film marks his second and last collaboration, with Puri Jagannadh after Desamuduru (2007).</p>
